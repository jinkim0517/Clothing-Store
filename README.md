# Clothing Store Inventory Management System

### A database system for a clothing store

For my project, I am planning on creating an inventory management system for a clothing store. This system will have 
two main non-trivial variables:
- a class called **Clothing**,
- and a class that is a list of **Clothing** called **Inventory**.

The target users for this system would be clothing store owners who would want to digitally manage their 
inventory for convenience and to better their business. This system would hold information about different pieces of 
clothing that someone like a manager could use to gain a better understanding of their business. This topic interests me
because clothes are an interest to me, and also, understanding how store inventory is managed and the types of functions
that can be useful would be a valuable skill if I were to create programs for companies in the business industry.

Some features that a user would want to do with this system are: 
- A user of this system would want to create one or multiple custom Clothing instances and add them to the inventory by inputting data
into an interface.

- A user of this system would want to remove as many items as they want from their store inventory (one at a time).

- A user of this system would want to change any field of a clothing item.

- A user of this system would want to view all the items in their store inventory.

- A user of this system would want to be able to save their clothing inventory to a file if they choose so.

- A user of this system would want to be able to load their previously saved clothing inventory from a file if they choose so.
